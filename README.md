The project activity titled, 2.7 MW Captive Solar Power Project GARL, Gujarat, is located at
Survey No: 76/01/P-1, 80, 89 and 91, Village: Meghpar Borichi, Taluka: Anjar, District: Bhuj, State:
Gujarat (370110), Country: India.

This is a single project activity of total installed capacity 2.7 MW, which is a ground mounted
captive solar power generation activity by M/s Gokul Agro Resources Limited (GARL, Project
Proponent or PP). The PP is one of the leading FMCG companies in India with international
presence in the edible and non-edible oils industry. GARL is engaged in the manufacturing and
exports of industrial products viz. castor oil of various grades and its derivatives.
The PP has the full ownership of the project activity.

This project is an operational activity with
continuous reduction of GHGs, currently being applied under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR),
which rewards solar programs with carbon credits as an incentive for positive climate action in the
Global South, as opposed to carbon finance in other international voluntary carbon programs. 
It's now widely accepted that the world needs to ramp up clean technologies by 2030 to prevent
permanent climate disaster, and carbon incentive policies, such as the UCR CoU program, will be
key to such efforts. India is aiming for 450 GW of renewables and 500 GW of non-fossil capacity
by 2030. With 110 GW already installed (as of 2021-22), the nation needs to deploy 340 GW of
new renewable energy capacity (on average, 42.5 GW of renewable energy per year for the next
eight years) to meet the 2030 target and offer the world some hope in combating climate change.
That would require the country’s solar capacity to rise fivefold to 280 GW from 54 GW during this
period. This translates to 29 GW of new solar capacity additions every year on average until the end
of this decade – a far faster pace than the nation’s record annual addition of 15 GW renewable
energy (14 GW of solar and 1 GW wind) in fiscal 2021-22.
_______________
Based on the audit conducted on the basis of UCR Protocol, which draws reference from UCR
Protocol Standard Baseline & Emission Factor, UNFCCC Methodology Category AMS-I.F. Small-scale
Methodology, Renewable electricity generation for captive use and mini-grid Ver 05, the audit
conducted remotely by way of video calls / verification, phone calls and the documents verified and
submitted during the verification including the Data, Project Concept Note (PCN) / Monitoring
Report (MR), SQAC is able to certify that the emission reductions from the project - 2.7MW Captive
Solar Power Project GARL, Gujarat, (UCR ID – 363) for the period 25/11/2020 to 31/12/2022
amounts to 8,119 CoUs (8,119 tCO2eq)
